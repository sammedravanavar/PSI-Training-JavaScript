1. Do not write code, create unit test function
2. Write your first unit test and make test fail


"Before each" statement is run for every statemen
'Mocks' are the dummy functions with no code but acts a real function. We can create a mock and then we will 
return the data from the mock. They are helpful in simualting the behaviour of dummy servers, dummy http calls

make sure your code is independent of UI
make sure your code is following the SRP(Single Responsibility Principle)
ensure that there are proper exception handling in your code
ensure your functions have return statements, should be testable


jasmine, mocha, jest -> unit testing Libraries
chai is an assertion library
sinon is a mock creation library

all the three libraries are having the describe statement(function)
purpose of describe ->  1.create environment
                        2.group unit test         
it function -> actual unit testing happens inside the it method
before each method -> this method will alloe you to set the data or mock data or mock functions 
                        These mock data can be set before execution of every unit test
